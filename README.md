CLI Calculator
This is a commmand line application that can solve basic expressions. This follows BEDMAS only to the extent of Brackets. I have provided a great expression you can use to get solved by the calcualtor.
I wrote this in ~2 Hours using:
- Recursion
- 2 SWITCH-CASE statements
- Hashmaps
This is simply a hobby project, and not great code. I have not bothered commenting anything as of writing this. I will update this with comments in the future if I'm feeling productive.

Here is a great expression you can try on the calculator:
(2*3)^(5-2)
